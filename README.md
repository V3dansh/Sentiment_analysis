Twitter is a widely used communication platform with approximately 321 million active users worldwide. Many officials use their Twitter accounts to communicate their actions and initiatives
to the public. This research project aims to present a novel framework for classifying a Twitter dataset obtained from Kaggle, consisting of approximately 31,962 tweets, using machine
learning techniques. The primary objective is to select the most suitable algorithm and metric for the machine learning classifier, as well as to analyze the metrics obtained from various learning
algorithms based on the dataset size.
